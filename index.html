    <h1>Hello,World!</h1>
    <p>Selections from CWD Index</p>
    <a href="https://stars.chromeexperiments.com">100,000 Stars (Michael Chang, Jono Brandel, Valdean Klump, et al, 2012)</a> <br>
    <p> a interactive map of all the nearby stars based on real astronomical datasets. allowing you to zoom, pan, and explore space right in your browser! <br> this website is very dear to me because I remember going on it around 2014 and thinking it was the coolest website ever made (i was nine), but regardless it is a remarkable showcase on how technology had evolved around that time and now it is a reminder how how much we have evolved since then. </p>

    <a href="https://wvnl.xyz/hereistoday/">Here is Today (No info on the CWD)</a> <br>
    <p> a creative web project that illustrates the entire span of the universe’s history, showing how tiny “today” is in that vast context, giving users a sense of deep time by letting you scroll or interact with the timeline visually, which is definitely something difficult to grasp with static timelines. <br> this is also a website i visted around high school if i remember correctly, and it definitely was a cool way visualize such a large amount of time.</p>

    <a href="https://thisxdoesnotexist.com">thisxdoesnotexist (Kashish Hora, 2019)</a> <br>
    <p> a directory showcasing examples of generative AI at work, from faces to objects that don’t exist, all produced by neural networks and GAN models.<br> this website is completely new to me unlike the other two and i believe has a new context under today's climate compared to when it was created. generative AI has evolved to a scary point where it can now fool the average person not attuned to it, and this website has definitely become a documentation of how generative AI has evolved since its development.</p>
